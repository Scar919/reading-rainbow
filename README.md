# Reading-Rainbow

## Description 

The motivation behind this project was to make an easier and quicker way for one to create a README.MD within the command line terminal. Creating a the README within the command line saves time and allows for a quicker process for developers to focus on other work wihtout needing to navigate through several different pages or tabs. I really enjoyed creating this project and had fun seeing the README at my fingetips. It felt like a better shortcut and will be using this method as much as possible.
